This is my first practical project with Node JS
I try to have a 
    login form
    Teacher can send Post
    Students can add comments bellow the posts
    List of all posts available
    Login will store a login record in the database
    Work hbs files
    Work with mySQL database
Also I will try to use github to manage my project versionning for the very first time!.
